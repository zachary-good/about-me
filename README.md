Lab 02
About Me
This is the project for my second lab. it is an about me website that will inform any visitors with some of the details about my life and who I am. I hope you enjoy the site and if you have any recommendations for improvements please let me know! Currently the website asks a series of five questions about me and takes in yes or no answers. 8/12 updated to 7 questions, a guess the number question and a guess my favorite food question has been added as well as all the questions have been made into functions during the partner programming session.
